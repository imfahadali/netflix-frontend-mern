A Netflix clone built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) is a web application that allows users to browse and stream a variety of movies and TV shows.

The frontend of the app, built with React, provide a user-friendly interface for browsing and searching for content, as well as for playing and controlling the playback of video. It includes features such as

 1. Watch Movie/TV Show
    
 2. Filter TV Shows/Movies based on genre
 3. Featured Movie/TV Show
 4. Netflix Carousel
 5. Top 10 Lists like Real Netflix
 6. User Authentication

The backend of the app, built with Node.js and the Express framework, handle the server-side logic and communication with the database. It use RESTful APIs to allow the frontend to request and receive data such as movie and TV show listings, user profiles and Top Lists. The backend might use MongoDB to store and retrieve data for the app, such as user accounts, Movies/TV Shows, and Lists.

Overall, a Netflix clone built with the MERN stack would be a fully-featured platform for streaming movies and TV shows, with UI almost a pixel perfect clone of the actual app.
